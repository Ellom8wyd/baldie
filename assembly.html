    <section id="step1">
      <h2>Step 1: Airframe Construction</h2>
      <p>This phase builds the structural skeleton of the EcoJet X1 using premium composite materials. Follow each detailed sub-step:</p>
      
      <h3>1.1 Preparing the Foam Core</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Materials & Tools:</strong> Rohacell foam block (minimum 300 mm x 100 mm x 50 mm), CNC cutting machine (or laser cutter), digital caliper, design template (DXF file), masking tape.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Marking the Profile:</strong> 
          <ul>
            <li>Download the provided DXF template outlining the fuselage profile (300 mm long with a maximum cross-section of 50 x 40 mm), wing outlines, and tail shapes.</li>
            <li>Place the Rohacell foam on the CNC machine bed. Use masking tape to secure it in place.</li>
            <li>Align the template with the foam and mark the boundaries using a fine-tip marker.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>CNC Cutting:</strong> 
          <ul>
            <li>Load the template into the CNC software.</li>
            <li>Set the cutting parameters: a cutting speed that minimizes foam melting (e.g., 800 mm/min) and a depth of cut of 2 mm per pass.</li>
            <li>Cut out the fuselage profile, then separately cut the wing cores and tail pieces.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Edge Finishing:</strong> 
          <ul>
            <li>After cutting, use fine-grit sandpaper to smooth the edges of each piece.</li>
            <li>Measure with a digital caliper to ensure dimensions are accurate.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>1.2 Composite Layup</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Materials & Tools:</strong> Toray T300 carbon fiber prepreg panels (2 mm thick), epoxy resin, vacuum bagging film, peel ply, vacuum pump, release film, brush, oven (set to 60°C), gloves.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Surface Preparation:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Clean the foam surfaces with isopropyl alcohol.</li>
            <li>Apply a thin coat of epoxy to help the carbon fiber bond with the foam core.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Layup Process:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Place the foam core (fuselage piece) on a clean, flat surface.</li>
            <li>Cut the carbon fiber panels to the exact dimensions of the foam core’s sides. (For a 300 mm fuselage with a 50 x 40 mm cross-section, cut two panels sized to cover each side, leaving a 5 mm extra margin for trimming.)</li>
            <li>Brush a uniform layer of epoxy on the foam core, then lay a carbon fiber panel on top.</li>
            <li>Repeat for the other side.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Vacuum Bagging:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Cover the assembly with release film and then the vacuum bagging film. Seal the edges with adhesive tape.</li>
            <li>Connect the vacuum pump and pull down to a pressure of approximately 0.09 MPa (or as recommended by your epoxy system).</li>
            <li>Place the bagged assembly in an oven set to 60°C and cure for 2 hours.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>1.3 Internal Bulkhead & Wiring Channels</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Marking:</strong> On the cured fuselage, measure 150 mm from the nose and mark a line across the internal width.
          <br><em>Tip:</em> Use a metal ruler and a fine-tip marker for precision.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cutting the Bulkhead:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Using a sharp utility knife, cut out a thin disk from an extra piece of foam (approx. 45 mm diameter) that matches the fuselage interior curvature.</li>
            <li>Sand the edges lightly to ensure a flush fit.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Installing the Bulkhead:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Apply a high-strength epoxy along the bulkhead’s perimeter.</li>
            <li>Fit it into the fuselage at the 150 mm mark, ensuring it is perfectly horizontal.</li>
            <li>Clamp it in place and let cure for at least 1 hour before moving on.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Wiring Channels:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Using a thin, heated blade or hot wire cutter, create small channels (approximately 3 mm wide) along the inner walls for routing motor and sensor wires.</li>
            <li>Ensure the channels follow the fuselage’s curve to avoid sharp bends in the wiring.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Battery Connection:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Place the Tattu 3S 1800mAh LiPo in the designated battery compartment at the front of the fuselage.</li>
            <li>Connect the battery to a central power distribution board (or directly to the ESCs if wiring is short) using XT60 connectors.</li>
            <li>Route the battery wires through the previously cut channels and secure them with adhesive cable clips.</li>

    <!-- Step 5: Final Assembly & Testing -->
    <section id="step5">
      <h2>Step 5: Final Assembly & Testing</h2>
      <p>With all subsystems installed, the final stage is to integrate everything and perform rigorous testing.</p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Integration:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Carefully bring together the airframe (with its internal bulkhead, wiring channels, and composite skins) with all propulsion, electronic, and electromagnetic subsystems.</li>
            <li>Use the custom mounting brackets and fasteners (ensure all screws are torqued to manufacturer specifications, typically 0.3 Nm for small M3 screws) to secure each component.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Wiring Inspection:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Double-check all solder joints and connector crimps using a multimeter to ensure continuity and proper voltage levels.</li>
            <li>Label all wires with small heat-shrink tags indicating their destination (e.g., “Motor 1”, “ESC 2”, “LED Data”).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bench Testing:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Power up the system (using a safety switch or fuse) and test each motor individually. Verify that the ESCs respond correctly to throttle input from the autopilot.</li>
            <li>Simulate a landing by manually engaging the electromagnet circuit and ensuring that the runway system detects the contact and transfers power.</li>
            <li>Run a full sensor check through the Pixhawk 4, confirming that all telemetry (current, voltage, temperature) is within expected ranges.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Flight Testing:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Begin with low‑altitude hover tests in a controlled environment. Use the autopilot’s safety parameters to limit altitude and speed.</li>
            <li>Gradually test the active flap control, recording servo movements and ensuring smooth transitions.</li>
            <li>Test the electromagnetic landing system by performing short, controlled landing runs on the runway panel, and adjust the power transfer timing as needed.</li>
            <li>After successful initial flights, incrementally increase speed and altitude while closely monitoring telemetry data.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Final Note:</strong> Document each test flight in detail—note any adjustments required in motor timing, servo calibration, or electromagnet engagement. This data is essential for fine‑tuning the EcoJet X1 before full‑scale operation.</p>
